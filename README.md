# Wiki
My attempt at making a cheap and cheerful wiki

## To-do list
- ### Create Form
	- Input validation
	- Something is wrong with the sub categories, probably need to add some JS
- ### Misc
	- Add reference pages
   	- Add images
   	- Add login
   	- Add autocomplete to the search bar
   	- Change the font size of inline mathematics (is this possible)
   	- Change the index to display 1 letter at a time
   	- Add a total page count (maybe)
   	- Alphabetise the sub-category lists

## Known issues
- The database connection is definitely the most secure thing in the world
