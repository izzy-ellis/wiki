# Wiki
My attempt at making a cheap and cheerful wiki

## To-do list
- ### Create Form
	- Input validation
	- Something is wrong with the sub categories, probably need to add some JS
   	- Display abbreviation reference better
   	- Add LaTeX reference sheet
   	- Format the input boxes to actually be roughly the right size
- ### Misc
	- Probably get rid of tagging
	- Add reference pages
   	- Add images
   	- Add login
   	- Add LaTeX (see MathJax, https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted)
   		- Check the ```npm``` installation worked
   	- Add autocomplete to the search bar

## Known issues
- The tag autocomplete is rusty as hell, throws lots of minor errors, none of them seem to be fatal though
  	- Tags don't work on the live site. I couldn't tell you why not, but I'll probably scrap it
- The database connection is definitely the most secure thing in the world
