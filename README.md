# Wiki
My attempt at making a cheap and cheerful wiki

## To-do list
- Redesign edit form for handling the actual pages
- Change around linking to work with abbreviations
- Add CSS
- Add better tag mechanics
- Add search feature

## Known issues
- When linking in Markdown, you need to include the root folder of the page (in this case /wiki/page.php). I do not know if this will apply on LAMP (I guess it depends on whether I have a root folder)
